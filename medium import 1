Real estate is one of the most rewarding markets for investment. Great financial returns are dependent upon your ability to find solid real estate deals. Many people suggest starting in the real estate game by receiving a realtor's license and using a multiple listing service or MLS. While both of these will help within the real estate world, they certainly aren't necessary for success. You don't need a realtor's license to flip houses, and an MLS isn't the only way to find great deals on the market. 
The key to real estate success is knowing where to look. There are great deals on the market right now. By knowing where to find these deals, you'll be able to flip houses with ease and high profits. Here are four simple tricks to finding the best real estate options. 
Foreclosure and Pre-foreclosure Properties 
Some of the best times to land a real estate deal are during foreclosure and pre-foreclosure terms. As foreclosures are public information, real estate investors have complete access to these listings. Because competition can be fierce on these foreclosure properties, many brokers will approach the homeowners within the 90-day foreclosure period. During this three-month period, owners of a foreclosure property can make a quick sale and walk away. 
Real estate investors also look for good deals on auction listings. It's important to know that buying a foreclosure property at these auctions comes with all of the debts and liens that are associated with the house. You need to do enough research beforehand to understand the entire deal at these auctions. Bidders are not warned about such information ahead of time. 
Talk to Landlords 
Speaking with many different landlords is another great strategy for acquiring profitable real estate deals to flip. Many people will jump at a chance to get out from their role as landlord as the pressure can build up over time. Offering landlords an out can end up landing you some excellent deals. 
As many of these properties are privately owned, you may be able to have the house inspected before purchase. Close inspections are often a rare case in the market of flipping houses. This is a great way to secure a purchase and clear any doubt of the property being a sound investment. 
Start Advertising 
Advertising is a critical component of every business. The same is true when it comes to flipping houses. You should start advertising through as many mediums as possible. With the right combination of Facebook ads, strategically-placed signs, pay-per-click ads, and mailbox flyers, you may be able to land a few deals rather quickly. Let the world know you're willing to pay cash for homes without any stress. This pitch always generates a few interested sellers. 
Advertising is also a great way to find houses to buy. As you drive around neighborhoods to advertise, leave notes or business cards with properties that pique your interest. This gesture takes only a small amount of effort, but it has the chance of generating a lot of good deals. 
Learn from the Pros 
The tips mentioned in this article are a great place to get started with real estate and the house-flipping market. However, there is so much more to learn about this industry. Real estate is often touted as the most lucrative of investments. While this reigns true, profiting from this industry will require a lot of expertise and experience. There are many amateurs who lose a lot of money trying to flip houses. The problem is with their lack of knowledge and not with the market.
